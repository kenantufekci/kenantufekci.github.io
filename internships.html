            <h2>Education and Internships</h2>
            <p>
                I graduated with a B.S. degree in Computer & Information Science & Engineering program at the University of Florida.
                I am proficient in C, C++, Java, Python , HTML, Javascript, CSS programming languages. I have also recently had an internship for Enterprise Architecture and learned how to apply an EA framework
                in order to drive business transformation.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have had many different types of leadership opportunities through my career, which has gave me many different types of leadership experience.
                Currently, I am acting as project manager and lead software engineer
                for the Integrated Product and Process Design program at UF for the integration of wearable sensors to Medtronic Nexus-D for closed-loop deep brain stimulation.

                My education throughout the many years of school and different internship experiences will
                help me become an essential asset of both your Software Engineering and Enterprise Architecture teams.

                In my youth I was naturally drawn to leadership when working on activities with my friends and classmates. It was
                only in my later years I came to appreciate the responsibility assumed by leadership. I am excited to be mentored
                by the leaders of this company and gaining wisdom from their many years of corporate leadership experience. I am
                looking forward to the prospect of honing my professional skills in vital qualities such as project leadership,
                continuous improvement, innovative thinking, and conflict resolution, all while driving teamwork and foster the
                best in others.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was instrumental in organizing and serving as President of The Undergraduate Research Society. President of
                The Florida Engineering Society, President of The Tutoring Club, and Treasurer for Gator Robotics. The experiences
                I gained during my terms of office helped me build a strong foundation in leadership. I created and implemented policies
                and procedures, in collaboration with my team, faculty and administration. My excellent interpersonal skills enabled
                me to manage many group projects in a productive and amicably manner. I always portray a supportive attitude towards
                fellow students promoting mutual cooperation and teamwork.

                In the summer of 2015, I was hired by Jabil Corporation as an Enterprise Architect Intern in the Information Technology Corporate
                headquarters under Chase Chritensen. During my time there I worked closely with many senior director including the CIO,
                Gary Cantrell. I learned how a large global corporation operates holistically, and how all facets of an enterprise is
                managed and governed.This was an enriching experience that gave me a much better perspective of how essential IT's role
                is to a corporation. This internship broadened my horizons for what corporate leadership entails, and how important the
                function of enterprise architecture is to a company's success.

                In the summer of 2014, I was hired as a software engineering intern for Lockheed Martin in Mission Systems and Testing
                (MST) at the Orlando, FL facility (summer 2014). I worked for IRAD under Cindy Eng and was tasked with the TPS automatic
                translator. I wrote a standalone program that parsed ATLAS code and then converted it into a workable C code. I later
                incorporated that code into the master solution which was used in a demo for the product. While I worked in ATE under
                Alicia Helton I updated the SDK image build procedure for Win XP to Win 7, mapped all the CVI Support Handlers and their
                functions for SDK Tester, updated the SDK Tester Sequence files, used TestStand to test procedures for SDK in Win 7, and
                worked with Storm GUI for LM-STAR. I also participated in the Summer Intern Innovation Challenge at Lockheed Martin. This
                was a 10 hour event. In 6 hours I learned how to program the Raspberry Pi in Python, and how to apply that knowledge to
                build circuits. The final competition consisted of all the engineering interns being divided into groups of four with each
                group having only 2.5 hours to design a spy gadget that MI6 would present to James Bond. My team won 1st place in the
                competition.

            <h2>Integrated Product and Process Design</h2>

            <P>
                The Integrated Product and Process Design (IPPD) program is an innovative educational initiative at the College of Engineering,
                University of Florida. I will work in a small multidisciplinary teams under the guidance of faculty coaches and industrial
                liaison engineers to design and build authentic industrial products for sponsoring companies.
            </P>
            <p>
                IPPD is a prestigious program that requires academic excellence in order to be admitted.
                I am proud to be among the most elite engineering student at UF for our year long journey to understand how to manage a live project
                applying all the skills we have learned here at the University of Florida.

                I completed the IPPD program at the University of Florida.
                I am working as Project Manager and Lead Software Engineer for CerebroStim IPPD group for our client Medtronic Inc.
                The purpose of this project is to implement an integration of wearable sensors to medtronic Nexus-D for closed-loop
                deep brain stimulation.

                We are developing an external system that collects data from a wide range of sensors (e.g. IMU) and drives the Internal
                Neurostimulator (INS). This system will work in conjunction with Nexus D, which is an interface to a neurostimulator implanted
                in a patient’s chest. Basically, we are developing a closed-loop neuro-stimulation system.
