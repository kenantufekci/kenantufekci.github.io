                    I am currently a Senior in the Computer & Information Science & Engineering program at the University of Florida.
                    I am proficient in C, C++, and Java programming languages. My education throughout the many years of school will
                    help me become an essential asset of your software development team.

                    In my youth I was naturally drawn to leadership when working on activities with my friends and classmates. It was
                    only in my later years I came to appreciate the responsibility assumed by leadership. I am excited to be mentored
                    by the leaders of this company and gaining wisdom from their many years of corporate leadership experience. I am
                    looking forward to the prospect of honing my professional skills in vital qualities such as project leadership,
                    continuous improvement, innovative thinking, and conflict resolution, all while driving teamwork and foster the
                    best in others.
                </p>

                    I was instrumental in organizing and serving as President of The Undergraduate Research Society. President of
                    The Florida Engineering Society, President of The Tutoring Club, and Treasurer for Gator Robotics. The experiences
                    I gained during my terms of office helped me build a strong foundation in leadership. I created and implemented policies
                    and procedures, in collaboration with my team, faculty and administration. My excellent interpersonal skills enabled
                    me to manage many group projects in a productive and amicably manner. I always portray a supportive attitude towards
                    fellow students promoting mutual cooperation and teamwork.

                    Last summer, I was hired by Jabil Corporation as an Enterprise Architect Intern in the Information Technology Corporate
                    headquarters under Chase Chritensen. During my time there I worked closely with many senior director including the CIO,
                    Gary Cantrell. I learned how a large global corporation operates holistically, and how all facets of an enterprise is
                    managed and governed.This was an enriching experience that gave me a much better perspective of how essential IT's role
                    is to a corporation. This internship broadened my horizons for what corporate leadership entails, and how important the
                    function of enterprise architecture is to a company's success.

                    In the summer of 2014, I was hired as a software engineering intern for Lockheed Martin in Mission Systems and Testing
                    (MST) at the Orlando, FL facility (summer 2014). I worked for IRAD under Cindy Eng and was tasked with the TPS automatic
                    translator. I wrote a standalone program that parsed ATLAS code and then converted it into a workable C code. I later
                    incorporated that code into the master solution which was used in a demo for the product. While I worked in ATE under
                    Alicia Helton I updated the SDK image build procedure for Win XP to Win 7, mapped all the CVI Support Handlers and their
                    functions for SDK Tester, updated the SDK Tester Sequence files, used TestStand to test procedures for SDK in Win 7, and
                    worked with Storm GUI for LM-STAR. I also participated in the Summer Intern Innovation Challenge at Lockheed Martin. This
                    was a 10 hour event. In 6 hours I learned how to program the Raspberry Pi in Python, and how to apply that knowledge to
                    build circuits. The final competition consisted of all the engineering interns being divided into groups of four with each
                    group having only 2.5 hours to design a spy gadget that MI6 would present to James Bond. My team won 1st place in the
                    competition.
